To Taos pueblo out in New MexicoOne night my weary feet did goSo I stopped that night in TaosThere's a story in Taos townThat if a stranger comes aroundWhen a fresh snow is on the groundA new love will be born in TaosThat night there came a snowIn the mountains and the valleys belowAnd I found a love that's true I knowIn Taos, New Mexico

That night in Taos townIt seemed love was all aroundAnd the pretty little girl I foundA new love was born in TaosFrom the first time we metI knew her love would always be trueAnd I know I'll always love her tooThe love that I found in TaosSome night if it should snowThere's a place you really ought to goThere's a legend that it's trueI know in Taos, New Mexico
