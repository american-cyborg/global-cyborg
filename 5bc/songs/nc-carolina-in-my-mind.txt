In my mind I'm gone to CarolinaCan't you see the sunshine?Can't you just feel the moonshine?Ain't it just like a friend of mineTo hit me from behind?Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind

Karin, she's a silver sunYou best walk her way and watch it shineWatch her watch the morning comeA silver tear appearing nowI'm cryin', ain't I?Gone to Carolina in my mind

There ain't no doubt in no ones mindThat love's the finest thing aroundWhisper something soft and kindAnd hey babe, the sky's on fireI'm dying, ain't I?Gone to Carolina in my mind

In my mind I'm gone to CarolinaCan't you see the sunshine?Can't you just feel the moonshine?Ain't it just like a friend of mineTo hit me from behind?Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind

Dark and silent, late last nightI think I might have heard the highway callAnd geese in flight and dogs that biteThe signs that might be omens sayI'm goin', I'm goin'I'm gone to Carolina in my mind

With a holy host of others standin' around meStill I'm on the dark side of the moonAnd it seems like it goes on like this foreverYou must forgive me, if I'm up and gone toCarolina in my mind
