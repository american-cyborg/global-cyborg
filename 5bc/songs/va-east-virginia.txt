I was born in East VirginiaNorth Carolina I did roamThere I met a fair pretty maidenHer name and age I do not knowHer air it was of a brightsome colorAnd her lips of a ruby redOn her breast she wore white liliesThere I longed to lay my headWell, in my heart you are my darlin'At my door you're welcome inAt my gate I'll meet you my darlin'If your love I could only winI'd rather be in some dark hollerWhere the sun refuse to shineThan to see you be another man's darlin'And to know that you'll never be mineWell in the night I'm dreamin' about youIn the day I find no restJust the thought of you my darlin'Sends aching pain all through my breastWell when I'm dead and in my coffinWith my feet turned toward the sunCome and sit beside me darlin'Come and think on the way you done
