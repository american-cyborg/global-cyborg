Out in the West Texas town of El PasoI fell in love with a Mexican girlNighttime would find me in Rosa's CantinaMusic would play and Feleena would whirlBlacker than night were the eyes of FeleenaWicked and evil while casting a spellMy love was deep for this Mexican maidenI was in love, but in vain, I could tellOne night a wild young cowboy came inWild as the West Texas windDashing and daring, a drink he was sharingWith wicked Feleena, the girl that I lovedSo in anger I challenged his right for the love of this maidenDown went his hand for the gun that he woreMy challenge was answered in less than a heartbeatThe handsome young stranger lay dead on the floorJust for a moment I stood there in silenceShocked by the foul evil deed I had doneMany thoughts raced through my mind as I stood thereI had but one chance and that was to runOut through the back door of Rosa's I ranOut where the horses were tiedI caught a good one, it looked like it could runUp on its back, and away I did ride
