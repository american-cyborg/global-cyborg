These tables are hauntedBy the ghost of Las VegasTheir chips were once mountainsBut they came here to playThey could take me if they wantedBut I have nothing worth countingAnd like the sands of NevadaThey go drifting away

Lady luck's still a mysteryWith her head on my shoulderAnd I don't know whyÂ I still want her to danceI guess that's all historyWhat it is is a I'm olderAnd I'm still a foolFor a one-way romance

Her dice were red rubiesThey rolled and they tumbledAnd I never saw timeRunning out with my rollAnd in the wasteland of cut glassMy dreams were all crumbledAnd I've paid with whateverI had left for a soul

Now the dawn's broken evenOn a empty horizonNo reason for foldingNo reason to stayIt's too soon to be leavingToo late for criticizingAnd the sands of NevadaThey go drifting away
