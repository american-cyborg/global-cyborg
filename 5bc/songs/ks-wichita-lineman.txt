I am a lineman for the countyAnd I drive the main roadSearchin' in the sun for another overloadI hear you singin' in the wire,I can hear you through the whineAnd the Wichita lineman is still on the line

I know I need a small vacationBut it don't look like rainAnd if it snows that stretch down south won't ever stand the strainAnd I need you more than want you,And I want you for all timeAnd the Wichita lineman is still on the line

And I need you more than want you,And I want you for all timeAnd the Wichita lineman is still on the line
