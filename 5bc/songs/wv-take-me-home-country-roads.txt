Almost heaven, West VirginiaBlue ridge mountains, Shenandoah riverLife is old there, older than the treesYounger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze

Country roads, take me homeTo the place I belongWest Virginia, mountain mommaTake me home, country roads

All my memories, they gather 'round herMiner's lady, stranger to blue waterDark and dusty, painted on the skyMisty taste of moonshine, teardrops in my eyes

Country roads, take me homeTo the place I belongWest Virginia, mountain mommaTake me home, country roads

I hear her voice in the mornin' hour she calls meThe radio reminds me of my home far awayAnd drivin' down the road I get a feelingThat I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

Country roads, take me homeTo the place I belongWest Virginia, mountain mommaTake me home, country roads

Country roads, take me homeTo the place I belongWest Virginia, West Virginia, mountain momma, oh mommaTake me home, country roadsTake me home, down country roadsTake me home, down country roads
