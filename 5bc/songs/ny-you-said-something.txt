On a rooftop in BrooklynAt one in the morningWatching the lights flashIn Manhattan

I see five bridgesThe Empire State BuildingAnd you said somethingThat I've never forgotten

We lean against railingsDescribing the colorsAnd the smells of our homelandsActing like lovers

How did we get here?To this point of living?I held my breathAnd you said something

And I'm doing nothing wrongRiding in your carThe radio playingWe sing up to the eighth floor

A rooftop, ManhattanAt one in the morningAnd you said somethingThat I've never forgotten

You said somethingYou said somethingYou said somethingThat was really important
