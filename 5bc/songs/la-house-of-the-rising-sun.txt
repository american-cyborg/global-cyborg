There is a house in New OrleansThey call the Rising SunAnd it's been the ruin of many a poor girlAnd God I know I'm one

My mother was a tailorShe sewed my new bluejeansMy father was a gamblin' manDown in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needsIs a suitcase and trunkAnd the only time he's satisfiedIs when he's on, a drunk

Oh mother tell your childrenNot to do what I have doneSpend your lives in sin and miseryIn the House of the Rising Sun

Well I got one foot on the platformThe other foot on the trainI'm goin' back to New OrleansTo wear that ball and chain

Well, there is a house in New OrleansThey call the Rising SunAnd it's been the ruin of many a poor boyAnd God I know I'm one
