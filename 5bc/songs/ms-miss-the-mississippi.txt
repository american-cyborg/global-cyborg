I'm growing tired of the big cityâ€™s lightsTired of the glamor and tired of the sightsIn all my dreams I'm roaming once moreDown to my home on the old river shore

I am sad and wearyFar away from homeMiss the Mississippi and youDays are dark and drearyEverywhere I roamMiss the Mississippi and you

Rolling the wide world overAlways alone and blue, blueNothing seems to cheer meUnder heaven's domeMiss the Mississippi and you

(Yodel)

Memories are bringingHappy days of yoreMiss the Mississippi and youMockingbirds are ringing around the cabin doorMiss the Mississippi and you

Rolling the whole world overAlways alone and blue, so blueLonging for my homelandMuddy water shoreMiss the Mississippi and you
