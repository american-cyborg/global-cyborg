AL - John Henry

John Henry was a little baby
Sitting on his mama's knee
He picked up a hammer and a little piece of steel
Cried, "Hammer's gonna be the death of me, Lord Lord
Hammer's gonna be the death of me"

John Henry said to his shaker,
"Shaker, why don't you sing?
I'm slinging thirty pounds from my hips on down
Just listen to that cold steel ring ring ring
Listen to that cold steel ring"

The captain said to John Henry
"Gonna bring that steam drill around
Gonna bring that steam drill out on the job,
gonna whop that cold steel down, down, down
Whop that steel on down"
John Henry said to the captain,
"Well a man ain't nothing but a man,
But before I let your steam drill beat me down,
I'd die with a hammer in my hand, Lord, Lord
I'd die with a hammer in my hand"

The man that invented the steam drill
Thought it was mighty fine
But John Henry made fifteen feet
And the steam drill only made nine,
The steam drill only made nine
John Henry hammered in the mountain
His hammer was striking fire
But he worked so hard he broke his poor heart
He laid down his hammer and he died
He laid down his hammer and he died

John Henry had a little woman
Her name was Polly Ann
She walked out to the tracks, picked up his hammer
Polly Ann drove steel like a man, man, man
Polly Ann drove steel like a man
Now every Monday morning
When the bluebird begins to sing
Every locomotive that come rolling by hollers,
"There lies steel driven by a man, Lord Lord
There lies steel driven by a man
