O Shenandoah, are you calling?Hi-o, you rolling riverO Shenandoah, I long to hear youAway, I'm bound away'Cross the wide Missouri

"O Shenandoah, I love your daughterAlong this rolling riverI'll take her 'cross the rolling water"Away, I'm bound away'Cross the wide Missouri

The chief disdained the trader's dollarsAway, on yon rolling river"My daughter never you shall follow."Away, I'm bound away'Cross the wide Missouri

At last there came a Yankee skipperOn down the rolling riverHe winked his eye and he tipped his flipperAway, I'm bound away'Cross the wide Missouri

He sold the chief that fire-waterWhat say you, rolling river?â€˜Cross the river they stole his daughterAway, I'm bound away'Cross the wide Missouri

Missouri, she's a mighty riverHi-o, you rolling riverWhen she rolls down, her topsails shiverAway, I'm bound away'Cross the wide Missouri
