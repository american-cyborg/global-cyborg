I saw her standin' on her front lawn just twirlin' her batonMe and her went for a ride sir and ten innocent people diedFrom the town of Lincoln Nebraska with a sawed-off .410 on my lapThrough to the badlands of Wyoming I killed everything in my pathI can't say that I'm sorry for the things that we doneAt least for a little while sir, me and her we had us some funNow the jury brought in a guilty verdict and the judge he sentenced me to deathMidnight in a prison storeroom with leather straps across my chestSheriff when the man pulls that switch sir and snaps my poor neck backYou make sure my pretty baby is sittin' right there on my lapThey declared me unfit to live, said into that great void my soul'd be hurledThey wanted to know why I did what I didWell sir I guess there's just a meanness in this world
