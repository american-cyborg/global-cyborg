The longest train I ever sawWent down that Georgia lineThe engine passed at six o'clockAnd the cab passed by at nine

Black girl black girl don't lie to meTell me where did you sleep last night?In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shinesI'll shiver the whole night through

My husband was a railroad manKilled a mile and a half from townHis head was bound in a driver's wheelAnd his body, heaven'll never be found

Black girl black girl, where will you go?I'm going where the chilly winds blowYou caused me to weep, and you caused me to mournYou caused me to leave my home

I asked my captain for the time of dayHe said he throw'd his watch awayIn the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shinesI'll shiver the whole night through
