Derry down, down, down, Derry down

Come all you bold sailors that follow the lakesOn an iron ore vessel your living to makeI shipped in Chicago, bid adieu to the shoreFound a way to Escanaba for red iron oreDerry down, down, down, Derry down

In the month of September, the seventeenth dayTwo dollars and a quarter is all they would payAnd on Monday morning the bridgeport did takeThe E. C. Roberts way out in the lakeDerry down, down, down, Derry down

Next morning we hove alongside the exileAnd soon was made fast to an iron ore pileThey lowered their chutes and like thunder did roarThey spouted into us that red iron oreDerry down, down, down, Derry down

Some sailors took shovels while others got spadesSome took wheelbarrows, each man to his tradeWe looked like red devils, our fingers got soreWe hated Escanaba and that blamed iron oreDerry down, down, down, Derry down

The tug Escanaba, she towed out the MinchThe Roberts she thought she had left in a pinchAnd when she passed how she bid us goodbyeSaying "We'll meet you in Cleveland next Fourth of July"Derry down, down, down, Derry down

Across Saginaw Bay the Roberts did rideWith the dark and deep water rolling over her sideNow for Port Huron the Roberts must goWhere the tug Katy Williams she took us in towDerry down, down, down, Derry down

Now the Roberts is in Cleveland, made fast stem and sternAnd over the bottle we'll spin a big yarnBut Captain Harvey Shannon had ought to stand treatFor getting into Cleveland ahead of the fleetDerry down, down, down, Derry down

Now my song is ended, I hope you won't laughOur dunnage is packed and all hands are paid offHere's a health to the Roberts, she's staunch, strong and trueNot forgotten the bold boys that comprise her crewDerry down, down, down, Derry down
