Hey Charley I'm pregnantLiving on 9th StreetRight above a dirty bookstoreOff Euclid AvenueI stopped taking dopeAnd I quit drinking whiskeyAnd my old man plays the tromboneAnd works out at the track

He says that he loves meEven though its not his babyHe says that he'll raise him upLike he would his own sonHe gave me a ringThat was worn by his motherAnd he takes me out dancin'Every Saturday night

Hey Charley I think about youEvery time I pass a fillin' stationOn account of all the greaseYou used to wear in your hairI still have that recordOf Little Anthony and The ImperialsBut someone stole my record playerHow do ya like that?

Hey Charley I almost went crazyAfter Mario got bustedI went back to OmahaTo live with my folksEveryone I used to knowWas either dead or in prisonSo I came back to MinneapolisThis time I think I'm gonna stay

Hey Charley I think I'm happyFor the first time since my accidentI wish I had all the moneyThat we used to spend on dopeI'd buy me a used car lotAnd I wouldn't sell any of 'emI'd just drive a different car every dayDependin' on how I feel

Hey Charley, for chrissakesDo you want to know the truth of it?I don't have a husbandHe don't play the tromboneI need to borrow moneyTo pay this lawyerAnd Charley, heyI'll be eligible for paroleCome Valentine's Day
