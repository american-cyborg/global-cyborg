I was walking through icy streams
That took my breath away
Moving slowly through westward water
Over glacial plainsAnd I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me oh my I thought it was a dream
So it seemed

And now, breathe deep
I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Leave me beI'm exhaling
You and I, there's air in between
You and I, there's air in between

Cut my hair so I could rock back and forth
Without thinking of you
Learned to talk and say
Whatever I wanted to
And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me oh my I thought it was a dream
So it seemed

And now, breathe deep
I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Leave me beI'm exhaling
You and I, there's air in between
You and I, there's air in between
You and I, there's air in between
