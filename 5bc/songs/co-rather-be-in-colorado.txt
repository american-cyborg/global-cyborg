I guess she'd rather be in ColoradoShe'd rather spend her time out where the sky looks like a pearl after a rainOnce again I see her walkin’ Once again I hear her talking to the stars she makesAnd asking them for bus fareI guess she'd rather be in ColoradoShe'd rather play her banjo in the morning when the moon is scarcely goneIn the dawn the subways comin’ in the dawn I hear her hummin'Some old song she wrote of love in Boulder CanyonI guess she'd rather be in ColoradoI guess she'd rather be in ColoradoI guess she'd rather work out where the only thing you earn is what you spendIn the end up in her officeIn the end a quiet cough is all she has to showShe lives in New York City
