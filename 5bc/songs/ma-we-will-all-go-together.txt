When you attend a funeralIt is sad to think that sooner orLater those you love will do the same for youAnd you may have thought it tragicNot to mention other adjec-Tives, to think of all the weeping they will doBut don't you worry

No more ashes, no more sackclothAnd an armband made of black clothWill some day never more adorn a sleeveFor if the bomb that drops on youGets your friends and neighbors tooThere'll be nobody left behind to grieve

And we will all go together when we goWhat a comforting fact that is to knowUniversal bereavementAn inspiring achievementYes, we all will go together when we go

We will all go together when we goAll suffuse with an incandescent glowNo one will have the enduranceTo collect on his insuranceLloyd's of London will be loaded when they go

Oh we will all fry together when we fryWe'll be french fried potatoes by and byThere will be no more miseryWhen the world is our rotisserieYes, we will all fry together when we fryDown by the old maelstromThere'll be a storm before the calm

And we will all bake together when we bakeThere'll be nobody present at the wakeWith complete participationIn that grand incinerationNearly three billion hunks of well-done steak

Oh we will all char together when we charAnd let there be no moaning of the barJust sing out a te deumWhen you see that I. C. B. M.And the party will be "come as you are"

Oh we will all burn together when we burnThere'll be no need to stand and wait your turnWhen it's time for the falloutAnd saint peter calls us all outWe'll just drop our agendas and adjourn

You will all go directly to your respective valhallasGo directly, do not pass go, do not collect two hundred dolla's

And we will all go together when we goEv'ry hottenhot and ev'ry eskimoWhen the air becomes uraniousAnd we will all go simultaneousYes we all will go togetherWhen we all go togetherYes we all will go together when we go
