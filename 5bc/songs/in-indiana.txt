She came to this world on a cold nightPapa turned his head and saidI don't believe she's mineSingle momma raised her in a place whereYou can look but never touchCause we don't have enoughDon't let your hopes get highCause girls like you can't flyOh the long nights in the small roomWith the big dreamsOh Indiana

You're only dying hereAnd they don't understand youIt's a tough road but you start slowAnd before you know itYou're not aloneLooking for a place called home anywhereOh Indiana

She tended bar in New York CityPeople turned their heads and saidBaby you sure look fineThey put her on TV and then they told herYou're gonna be a starYou can go so farLet your hopes get highCause girls like you can flyIn the long nights in the small roomWith the big dreamsOh Indiana

You're only dying, hereAnd they don't understand youIt's a tough road but you start slowAnd before you know itYou're not aloneLooking for a place called home, anywhereOh Indiana

Those big dreams are flying machinesAnd they'll take youWherever you want to goOh and sometimes you find that what's real is insideYou don't have to go awayTo find your way homeOh Indiana

She turned around and she topped runningShe saw that fame was never an answer to her prayersShe found that answer in her childrenWhen she takes them to a placeWhere they can have so muchShe lets their hopes get highCause anyone, anyone can flyIn the long nights in the small roomWith the big dreamsOh Indiana

You're only dying, hereAnd they don't understand youIt's a tough road but you start slowAnd before you know itYou're not aloneLooking for a place called home, anywhereOh IndianaOh she's going back

Oh oh oh
