There's a dirt floor underneath hereTo receive us when changes failMay this shovel loose your troubleLet them fall away

Well the mist shall be your blanketWhile the moss shall ease your headAs the future is soon forgottenAs the dirt shall be your bed

There's a dirt floor underneath hereTo receive us when changes failMay this shovel loose your troubleLet them fall away
