You ride in the park and you're peakingPiss pools in your seatShe’s standing inside but you surely repeatOh God, don't leave me here, I will freeze ‘til the endLove is love’s reprieve

Winter is coming and you're stuck hereOh and so is sheNow when the wind blows you cover your teethI told you to shed away and trade in your bluesLove is love’s sad news

That was Wisconsin, that was yesterdayNow I have nothing that I can keep‘cause every place I go I take another place with meLove is love’s mystique

You're up at the bar and you’re shakingWith every grimy wordWho will love, what’s love when you've hurt?You wonder as you see the snow kiss the curbLove is love’s returnThat was Wisconsin, that was yesterdayNow I have nothing that I can keep‘cause every place I go I take another place with meLove is love’s critique
