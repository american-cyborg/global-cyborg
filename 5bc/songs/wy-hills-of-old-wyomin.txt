Let me ride on the trail In the hills of old Wyomin'Where the coyotes wail in the gloamin’In the hills of old Wyomin'

In the night let me restWith the blue sky for my ceilin''Till the wind's lullaby comes stealin'From the hills where my heart’s at home

Wake with a song! Wake with the sun!Saddle to mend, cattle to tend, plenty to be done

Let me live on the range Where a woman has room to roam inAnd dream of her love in the gloamin’The moon she shines my path tonightIn the hills of old Wyomin'
