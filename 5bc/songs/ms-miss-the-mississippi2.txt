I'm growing tired of the big cityâ€™s lights

Tired of the glamor and tired of the sights

In all my dreams I'm roaming once more

Down to my home on the old river shore

I am sad and weary

Far away from home

Miss the Mississippi and you

Days are dark and dreary

Everywhere I roam

Miss the Mississippi and you

Rolling the wide world over

Always alone and blue, blue

Nothing seems to cheer me

Under heaven's dome

Miss the Mississippi and you

(Yodel)

Memories are bringing

Happy days of yore

Miss the Mississippi and you

Mockingbirds are ringing around the cabin door

Miss the Mississippi and you

Rolling the whole world over

Always alone and blue, so blue

Longing for my homeland

Muddy water shore

Miss the Mississippi and you
