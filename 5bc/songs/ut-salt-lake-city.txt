I got the picture, that you finally sentI read your letter, and I know what you meantThat's you and me, in Salt Lake CityYou sure look prettyWish we could go back again

And are you on my mind, every day, all the time?And though you're far away, don't you know, I feel the sameOh well anyway, I just called to sayEverything's gonna be okayYour friends aren't that far awayAnyway

Don't get so down on yourselfDon't get so down on yourselfDon't get so down on yourselfThink of me with you

Oh well anyway, I just called to sayEverything's gonna be okayYour friends aren't so far awayTomorrow's another day

Don't get so down on yourselfDon't get so down on yourselfDon't get so down on yourselfThink of me with you

Don't get so down on yourselfDon't get so down on yourselfDon't get so down on yourselfThink of me with you'Cause I do. I think of you
