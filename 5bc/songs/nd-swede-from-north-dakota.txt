I’ve been a Swede from North DakotaWorked on a farm for about two yearsThink I will go to MinnesotaTake a look at the big state fair

Buy me a ticket, buy me a bottleDress me up, clean out of sightJump on Jim Hill’s little red wagonFeel so good, I feel like a fight

Waking up the very next morningIn the city they call St. PaulJump on the streetcar, go to MinneapolisThink I’ll find some Swede men there

I go down to Seven CornersWalk in a saloon for funThere I meet this great big Swede girlSlap her on the shoulder, say “Hello there!”

And we drink and we feel jollyAnd we start to dance and singAnd I say to the other Swede fellows“I will pay for the whole blame thing!”

I wake up in jail next morningBy this fellow they call The BullAnd he says “Ten days or dollars –Cause you been so awful full”

I look through all my pocketsI can’t find no money for bailNothing’s left for this poor Swede girlBut to spend ten days in jail

I’m going back to North DakotaGet a job on a farm somewhereAnd all you people in MinnesotaGo jump in the lake with your big state fair!
