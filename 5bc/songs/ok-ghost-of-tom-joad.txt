Men walkin' 'long the railroad tracksGoin' someplace there's no goin' backHighway patrol choppers comin' up over the ridge

Hot soup on a campfire under the bridgeShelter line stretchin' 'round the cornerWelcome to the new world orderFamilies sleepin' in their cars in the SouthwestNo home no job no peace no rest

The highway is alive tonightBut nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goesI'm sittin' down here in the campfire lightSearchin' for the ghost of Tom Joad

He pulls a prayer book out of his sleeping bagPreacher lights up a butt and takes a dragWaitin' for when the last shall be first and the first shall be lastIn a cardboard box 'neath the underpassGot a one-way ticket to the promised landYou got a hole in your belly and gun in your handSleeping on a pillow of solid rockBathin' in the city aqueduct

The highway is alive tonightWhere it's headed everybody knowsI'm sittin' down here in the campfire lightWaitin' on the ghost of Tom Joad

Now Tom said "Mom, wherever there's a cop beatin' a guyWherever a hungry newborn baby criesWhere there's a fight 'gainst the blood and hatred in the airLook for me Mom I'll be thereWherever there's somebody fightin' for a place to standOr decent job or a helpin' handWherever somebody's strugglin' to be freeLook in their eyes Mom you'll see me."

Well the highway is alive tonightBut nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goesI'm sittin' down here in the campfire lightWith the ghost of old Tom Joad
