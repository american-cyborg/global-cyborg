When first I came to LouisvilleSome pleasure there to findA damsel fair from LexingtonWas pleasing my mindHer cherry cheeks and ruby lipsLike arrows pierced my breastThey called her Handsome MaryThe Lily of the West

I courted her awhileIn hopes her love to gainBut she proved false to meWhich caused me much painShe robbed me of my libertyDeprived me of my restThey called her Handsome MaryThe Lily of the West

One evening as I rambledOn down by a shady groveI saw a man of low degree Conversing with my loveThey were singing songs of melodyWhile I was sore distressedO faithless, faithless MaryThe Lily of the West

I stepped up to my rivalMy dagger in my handI caught him by the collarAnd bravely made him standBeing driven to desperationI stabbed him in the breastBut was betrayed by MaryThe Lily of the West!

At length the day of trial cameI boldly made my pleaBut the judge and jury They soon convicted meTo deceive both judge and jury So modestly she dressedAnd there she swore my life awayThe Lily of the West
