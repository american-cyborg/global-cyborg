New Jersey Turnpike, ridin' on a wet night 'neath the refinery's glow, out where the great black rivers flowLicense, registration, I ain't got none, but I got a clear conscience 'bout the things that I doneMister State Trooper please don't stop me...Maybe you got a kid maybe you got a pretty wife, the only thing that I got's been botherin' me my whole lifeMister State Trooper please don't stop meIn the wee wee hours your mind gets hazy, radio relay towers lead me to my babyRadio's jammed up with talk show stations, it's just talk, talk, talk till you lose your patienceMister State Trooper please don't stop meHey somebody out there, listen to my last prayerHi ho Silver-o, deliver me from nowhere
