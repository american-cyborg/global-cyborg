I was walking around in DenverOne luckless rainy dayWhen Kilpatrick's mancatcherCame up to me anâ€™ did sayI'll lay you down five dollarsQuickly as I canIf you'll hurry up and catch the trainShe's starting from CheyenneWay out in IdahoWay out in IdahoA-workin' on the narrow gaugeWay out in Idaho

Well he laid me down five dollarsLike many another manAnd I hurried to the depotAs happy as a clamWhen I got to PocatelloMy troubles begin to growI was waitin' in the sagebrushThe rain, the wind, the snowWay out in IdahoWay out in IdahoA-workin' on the narrow gaugeWay out in Idaho

When I got to American FallsIt was there I met Fat JackHe kept a little hotel tentAlong beside the trackNow says he, you are a strangerPerhaps your funds are lowWell yonder stands me hotel tentThe best in IdahoWay out in IdahoWay out in IdahoA-workin' on the narrow gaugeWay out in Idaho

Well he put me to work next morningWith a cranky cuss called BillThey gave me a ten pound hammerTo strike upon the drillThey said if I didn't like itI could take my shirts and goAnd they'd keep my blankets for my boardWay out in IdahoWay out in IdahoWay out in IdahoA-workin' on the narrow gaugeWay out in Idaho

Well it filled my heart with pityAs I walked along the tracksTo see so many old bundlersWith their packs upon their backsThey said the work was heavyThe grub they could not goAround Kilpatrick's dirty tablesWay out in IdahoWay out in IdahoWay out in IdahoA-workin' on the narrow gaugeWay out in Idaho

Well, now I'm well and workingDown in the harvest campsAnd there I will continueTill I make a few more stampsI'll go back to New MexicoMarry a girl I knowAnd we'll buy us a horse and buggyAnd go back to Idaho
