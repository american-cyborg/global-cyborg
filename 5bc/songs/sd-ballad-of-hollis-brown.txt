Hollis BrownHe lived on the outside of townHollis BrownHe lived on the outside of townWith his wife and five childrenAnd his cabin broken down

You looked for work and moneyAnd you walked a rugged mileYou looked for work and moneyAnd you walked a rugged mileYour children are so hungryThat they don't know how to smile

Your baby's eyes look crazyThey're a-tuggin' at your sleeveYour baby's eyes look crazyThey're a-tuggin' at your sleeveYou walk the floor and wonder whyWith every breath you breathe

The rats have got your flourBad blood has got your mareThe rats have got your flourBad blood it got your mareIf there's anyone that knowsIs there anyone that cares?

You prayed to the Lord aboveOh please send you a friendYou prayed to the Lord aboveOh please send you a friendYour empty pockets tell yuhThat you ain't a-got no friend

Your babies are crying louderIt's pounding on your brainYour babies are crying louderIt's pounding on your brainYour wife's screams are stabbin' youLike the dirty drivin' rain

Your grass it is turning blackThere's no water in your wellYour grass is turning blackThere's no water in your wellYou spent your last lone dollarOn seven shotgun shells

Way out in the wildernessA cold coyote callsWay out in the wildernessA cold coyote callsYour eyes fix on the shotgunThat's hangin' on the wall

Your brain is a-bleedin'And your legs can't seem to standYour brain is a-bleedin'And your legs can't seem to standYour eyes fix on the shotgunThat you're holdin' in your hand

There's seven breezes a-blowin'All around the cabin doorThere's seven breezes a-blowin'All around the cabin doorSeven shots ring outLike the ocean's pounding roar

There's seven people deadOn a South Dakota farmThere's seven people deadOn a South Dakota farmSomewhere in the distanceThere's seven new people born
