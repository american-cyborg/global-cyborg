He figures out a restaurant

Where they won't be recognized

He can always slip the maitre'd a ten

Get a private little table and try her on for size

Make a plan of where to do it when

He's so sly, he's in love with his lies

And the wives, the wives are in Connecticut

The wives, the wives are in Connecticut

Trying to forget it, that they really do regret it

That they moved up to Connecticut

That they moved up to Connecticut

The first year I was faithful

He confesses to the girl

Admitting to the least of his sins

His candour, so disarming,Â 

in this wicked city world

She falls for it and once again he wins

He's so sly, he's in love with his lies

And the wives, the wives are in Connecticut

The wives, the wives are in Connecticut

Trying to forget it, that they really do regret it

That they moved up to Connecticut

That they moved up to Connecticut

The five flight walk up

Can he make it?

He keeps promising to go back to the gym

He thinks about his wife

So passionate last night

Was she really feeling it for him

Or was it junior's teacher?

Or the carpenter who put up the shelves

Or the mechanic who fixed the wagon

Or the gardener who dug the well

Or the Italian riding instructor

Or the man on the carousel

Or the out of work actor in Westport

Or the surgeon who cured the elms

Or the man at the vegetable stand

Or the guru who cast a spell

Or the Yalie from New Haven

Or the farmer in the Dell

How about the lifeguard at the yacht club

The hairdresser from New London

The tennis pro from Fairfield

The Fuller Brush man from Bristol

The fisherman from Mystic

The novelist from New Canaan

The usher at the movie theater

The architect from Guilford

Or the man on the carousel?
