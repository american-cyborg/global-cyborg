The Mississippi Delta was shiningLike a National guitarI am following the riverDown the highwayThrough the cradle of the Civil WarI'm going to GracelandGracelandIn Memphis TennesseeI'm going to Graceland

Poor boys and Pilgrims with familiesAnd we are going to GracelandMy traveling companion is nine years oldHe is the child of my first marriageBut I've reason to believeWe both will be receivedIn Graceland

She comes back to tell me she's goneAs if I didn't know thatAs if I didn't know my own bedAs if I'd never noticedThe way she brushed her hair from her foreheadAnd she said losing loveIs like a window in your heartEverybody sees you're blown apartEverybody sees the wind blowI'm going to GracelandMemphis TennesseeI'm going to GracelandPoor boys and pilgrims with familiesAnd we are going to Graceland

And my traveling companionsAre ghosts and empty socketsI'm looking at ghosts and emptiesBut I've reason to believeWe all will be receivedIn Graceland

There is a girl in New York CityWho calls herself the human trampolineAnd sometimes when I'm falling, flyingOr tumbling in turmoil I sayOh, so this is what she meansShe means we're bouncing into Graceland

And I see losing loveIs like a window in your heartEverybody sees you're blown apartEverybody sees the wind blowIn Graceland, in GracelandI'm going to GracelandFor reasons I cannot explainThere's some part of me wants to seeGraceland

And I may be obliged to defendEvery love, every endingOr maybe there's no obligations nowMaybe I've a reason to believeWe all will be receivedIn Graceland
