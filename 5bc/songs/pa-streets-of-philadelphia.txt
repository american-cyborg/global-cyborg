I was bruised and batteredI couldn't tell what I feltI was unrecognizable to myselfI saw my reflection in a window, I didn't know my own faceOh brother are you gonna leave me wastin' awayOn the streets of Philadelphia

I walked the avenue, 'til my legs felt like stoneI heard the voices of friends vanished and goneAt night I could hear the blood in my veinsJust as black and whispering as the rainOn the Streets of Philadelphia

Ain't no angel gonna greet meIt's just you and I my friendAnd my clothes don't fit me no moreI walked a thousand milesJust to slip this skin

The night has fallen, I'm lyin' awakeI can feel myself fading awaySo receive me brother with your faithless kissOr will we leave each other alone like thisOn the Streets of Philadelphia
