In an old pickup truck, with his hat pulled downHe drives them old Montana backroadsRemembering half-forgotten times, and wondering where it's goneAnd if he can still carry the loadNow, the summer sun is setting, and the moon is on the riseAs he pulls that old pickup into townAnd he parks beside the place where the feed store used to beAnd he heads for an old familiar soundThose honky-tonk bands still play old-time songsRemembering how things used to beSitting at the bar with his head down in his handsSo alone with his memoriesLord, he's so alone with his memories

He remembers back in '33, or was it '34The year that he won the rodeoThe buckle that they gave him, well, he still wears todayFor that Brahma bull that he rodeBut his riding days are over now, his back is getting weakAnd his eyesight, it just ain't as goodAs the days he'd spot a deer at a hundred yards or moreAnd bring back a month's supply of foodThose honky-tonk bands still play old-time songsRemembering how things used to beSitting at the bar with his head down in his handsSo alone with his memoriesLord, he's so alone with his memories

Now the bar is getting set to close, they say he's got to leaveBut it feels like, Lord, he just arrivedSo he downs his last shot as he's heading for the doorGetting ready for that long and lonely driveIn an old pickup truck, with his hat pulled downHe drives them old Montana backroadsRemembering half-forgotten times, and wondering where it's goneAnd if he can still carry the loadThose honky-tonk bands still play old-time songsRemembering how things used to beAnd he tumbles through the door, and he falls down on his bedStill alone with his memoriesLord, he's still alone with his memories
